## ABOUT SNAPSHOT

**Heading**
What I'm about

**Content**
I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, elegant solutions. After completing CodeBoxx Academy's Full Stack program, I started building tools that make a real difference for clients. When I'm not coding for work, I'm studying Data Science at Open University or coaching new developers at CodeBoxx's AI bootcamp.

My approach? Understand the actual problem first, then build something that solves it without unnecessary complications.
