## FAQ SECTION

**Heading**
"Common Questions"

**Questions & Answers**

**Q: How do you typically work with clients?**
A: I start with a conversation to understand your needs, then provide a clear proposal with scope, timeline, and costs. During the project, I keep you updated regularly and deliver work in stages for feedback. My goal is a straightforward process with no surprises.

**Q: Do you work with clients outside of Tampa?**
A: Absolutely. While I'm based in Tampa, I work with clients worldwide. Most communication happens through video calls, email, and collaborative tools, making location largely irrelevant to a successful project.

**Q: What information do you need to provide an estimate?**
A: The more detail you can provide about your goals, timeline, and specific requirements, the more accurate my estimate will be. Even a rough idea is a good starting point—we can refine the details during our initial conversation.

**Q: How do you handle revisions and feedback?**
A: Feedback is built into my process. Each project includes dedicated review phases where you can provide input. My proposals clearly outline the number of revision rounds included, though I'm always flexible for reasonable adjustments.

**Q: Do you offer maintenance and support after launching?**
A: Yes. I offer various support options once your project is live, from hourly assistance to monthly maintenance packages. We'll discuss what makes sense for your specific needs.
