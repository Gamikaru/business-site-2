    content: `I leverage over 5 years of development experience to build solutions that actually work. After graduating from CodeBoxx's Full Stack bootcamp, I focused on mastering the MERN stack while simultaneously developing expertise in Python-based AI applications.

    When I'm not building client projects, I'm coaching new developers at CodeBoxx's AI bootcamp and deepening my knowledge through Open University's Data Science program. I believe deeply in practical education and hands-on mentorship.

    My approach combines technical precision with clear communication. I build what's needed—nothing less, nothing more—and make sure clients understand what they're getting at every step.`,
