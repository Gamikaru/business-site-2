    <p>When I'm not building client projects, I'm <span class="highlight">coaching new developers</span> at CodeBoxx's AI bootcamp and deepening my knowledge through <span class="highlight">Open University's Data Science program</span>. I believe deeply in <strong>practical education</strong> and <strong>hands-on mentorship</strong>.</p>

    <p>My approach combines <em>technical precision</em> with <em>clear communication</em>. I build what's needed—<strong>nothing less, nothing more</strong>—and make sure clients understand what they're getting at every step.</p>`,
