For me, when I'm reading someone's About page, I want to know what makes the person tick, what they enjoy doing away from work and get to know them somewhat before I consider them for my needs. Think of your About page as the place where you invite readers to get to know the real you. It's where you start building the connection that will grow into a strong, lasting relationship with your future clients or customers."

I'm originally from the rainy UK, but moved to the USA back in 2016. I told my husband I would stay for 3 years and, long story short, we're still here 8 years later!",

I may live in Florida but you can bet that I'll crank that AC down as low as possible just so I can trick my mind into thinking it's fall and not 100 degrees outside!",
